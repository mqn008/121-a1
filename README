[ HEURISTICS ] ----------------------------------------------------------------

	1.  Visibility of system status

		The interface provides the user with several text prompts to guide
		them through each step in the process of adding a new post. The text
		box contains placeholder text with clear instructions for next steps,
		and the button for adding audio also communicates its purpose to the
		user.
		The user can hit enter/return to send their post, but there is also
		a "post" button to further clarify current status.

	2.  Match between system and real world

		The app uses terms familiar to the user and avoids technical terms.
		Users can "like", "dislike", and "comment" on posts -- terms that are
		commonly used in other social media sites.
		Posts appear as a vertical timeline with most recent posts on top and
		older posts further down, so that users may easily stay up-to-date.

	3.  User control and freedom

		Users can easily modify and delete any text they put in the text box.
		Should the user delete all text they put in the box, the placeholder
		text will appear again to indicate their status.
		The user can also toggle the audio upload by simply clicking the + 
		button -- so if the user decides not to upload audio with their post 
		after all, they can simply click the audio upload off.
		Users are also given the option to delete their own posts.

	4.  Consistency and standards
